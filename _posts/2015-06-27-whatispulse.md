#What is Pulse?
**Pulse** is a Java graphical application that imports ilz streams and allows the user to view and manipulate the imported data. Pulse has several features that facilitate the analysis of data:

- Built in compiler/linker allowing customizable expressions, functions and macros for data manipulation and plotting
- Support of numerous data types: int, long, float, double, string, and boolean
- A built in library of plotting functions allowing access to Java's plotting capabilities
- Tabular data with row counts limited only by the amount of stack memory available to the JRE ( Java Runtime Environment ).

*NOTE: The largest ilz stream processed by Pulse consisted of 2 tables of 28.6M posix reads and writes, requiring only 2.3GB of memory by the JRE*
